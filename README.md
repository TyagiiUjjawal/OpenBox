PROBLEM STATEMENT


BLOCKCHAIN BASED
DONATION PLATFORM FOR
E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
 There are numerous alternatives for a person to
accomplish their desire of doing philanthropy. Ecommerce Websites offering an option to do so while
usual payments is not very new as well. But the lack
of transparency on these platforms have always
made the Donors reluctant.
 Donors usually have a resentment that the number of
claimed beneficiaries are not actually beneficiated.
 Statistics from HSE survey of 2017 project that 68% of
citizens are willing to donate even more if there are
evidences regarding judicious and transparent
transactions.
 Therefore, it is important to develop a Donation
platform for the E-commerce websites based on
Block Chain technology which will maintain an
external and decentralized database for all the
stakeholders of the process and hence, will provide
much more assurance to the consumer about the
optional extra amount that is added to their bills in
the name of Charity

SOLUTION
 We propose to incorporate additional functionalities to
the traditional E-commerce websites’ interface with the
help of addition of Block-chain technology that would
provide increased Customer control over charitable
transactions while protecting the privacy of Customer.
 Once the usual purchase of E-commerce website is done
by a user , The bill that will be generated for the user will
be accompanied by a BILL-ID generated specifically for
that purchase only.
 The BILL-ID will consist of the information regarding the
consumer and that particular purchase. The user will be
then redirected to a Donation Box interface and the BILLID will act as a sole key for logging into the interface.
 The Donation Box will allow the user to select the
desirable foundation/cause out of the listed and
authenticated Options.
 Once user opts for any one of them, the system will
automatically donate 10% of the revenue generated on the
purchase (this information will be provided by The BILLID as well).
 This whole transaction including the amount of donation,
the foundation name and the BILL-ID will be stored in an
external and decentralized database based on BlockChain technology which will be accessible to all the
parties involved that are :- Consumers, Foundations, ECommerce Organization, Government.
 Since the decentralized database consists of only BILLID of the user, their privacy is also protected.
 Foundations will request their enrolment with proper
government approved documentation. These requests
will be approved by administrator of the E-commerce
website.
